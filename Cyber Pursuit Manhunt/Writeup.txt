Solution:
At first instinct, you try to search for "h3ck3r_h3_bh41" on all platforms and come across a twitter profile named as "h3ck3r_h3_bh41" shown in (image_1.png). You see
a post from that account on twitter which mentions something about "Cookie the baby chick". Now that raises questions. I begin searching all platforms again for 
"cookie" and i find an instagram account which belongs cookie! shown in (image_2.png). Seeing the list of followers of cookie we find two followers (image_3.png).
That naruto account seems useless but the simon_j_peter one is interesting. Keeping that account at the back of our minds we continue searching for more clues as
the task is finding the full name and asscociated website domain. In one of the posts from cookie we find a website url. shown in (image_4.png). We open that url
and are redirected to a youtube channel which doesn't have any uploads though. The name of the channel is of interest shown in (image_5.png). I begin searching
all social media platforms again for "husky woof woof" (interesting name btw, kudos to the author for coming up with these, anyways back to the writeup). After
some searching i find a linkedin account with the username "husky woof woof" shown in image_6.png. After opening that account on linkedin, we find the caption
(Call me john) shown in image_7.png remember simon_j_peter, yes that j refers to John. So we have the full name, we need the website now. I begin searching the posts
of husky on linkedin to find something and I come across a link shown in image_8.png. Opening that link redirects to a page which has a photo "stock.jpg" and after
some exiftooling and reverse image searching (image_9.png and image_10.png) we find the location to be in chandrapur, maharashtra and afte googling for a while i find
tadoba national park (image_11.png) and voila that is the domain name. So that makes up the flag.
