Chall Name: Medicare Pharma
Chall Description: Greetings form MediCare Pharma!!!!
		   We have started a very new pharmacy where we have various surgical equipments (more to be added soon).
		   But recently some hackers took control of our server and changed a hell lot of things (probably wiped out everything). Luckily we have few of the 
		   accounts and we need more consumers on board. For security reasons, we have disabled SignUp, only authorised persons are allowed to login.
		   Have a look at our pharmacy and hope we grow again soon.

Given: A web Instance

Solution:
Loading up the webpage gives a Login Page, and the registration is closed. I tried SQL injection payloads on the username and password parameters and found " '* " to
be working (enter in both params for result) (image_1.png). After Using those payloads, i get the password and username of every user on the database (image_2.png) so 
i log in as the pharma owner with the password. Then after logging in i try ordering random stuff and after ordering like all the products i get an alert box saying
something about needles and a file named "pharmacy.php" is downloaded in my system. It looks like the source code of the website and one line is interesting where
it uses shell_exec() on the user input from the search bar. so i tried using ls command and it gives the output of ls (image_3.png). After searching for a bit I get 
the path of the flag which is stored at /root/flag.txt so i cat that file and get the flag (image_4.png).
