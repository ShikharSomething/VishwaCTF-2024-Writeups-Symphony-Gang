Chall Name: Poly Fun
Chall Description: Its a simple symmetric key encryption, I am sure you will be able to solve it (what do you mean the key looks weird)

Given: challenge.py (source code), encoded_key.txt, encoded_flag.txt

Solution:
Going through the source code you find a generate_random_number, generate_random_number_again and a transform function. After playing around for a bit you find that
transform function doesn't do anything with the number and just returns the number itself (check transform_function_test.py and image_1.png, image_2.png for more
information). Then this means that we also don't have to focus on those random number functions. Then we see that the key is encoded with a polynomial whose
coefficients are given in the code as (4,3,7). You can use the decrypt_key.py script to get the key. What the script basically does is get the roots of the polynomial
wrt to the encrypted key value to get the decrypted key value. The key is shown in image_3.png. Then you see the encoded_flag.txt file and you might notice it that
the flag is encrypted with aes I had to test out with all the aes to find out which one was actually right (plus the description also mentions "symmetric key
encryption"). As shown in image_4.png you can head over to that site and use the key and the encrypted text to get the flag in base64 value and then as shown in
image_5.png you can use that site to decrypt the base64 and get the flag.
