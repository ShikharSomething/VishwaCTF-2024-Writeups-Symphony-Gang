Chall Name: BitBane - Cryptic Chaos
Chall Description: Once again, Mr. David made a blunder by encrypting some confidential data and deleting the original file. Can you help him retrieve the data from 
		   the encrypted file?


Given: Encrypt.cpp, Encrypted.txt

Solution:
So after analyzing the source code, we get to know that it's a symmetric encryption so we can bruteforce each letter at a time and knowing the flag format
VishwaCTF{ makes it clearer. You can refer to the decrypt.py script to see the bruteforce process. (Sorry if this writeup is very small, it's like 12am and i'm
writing this i want to go to sleep sorry.)

Flag:
