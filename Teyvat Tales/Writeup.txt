Chall Name: Teyvat Tales
Chall Description: All tavern owners in Mondstadt are really worried because of the frequent thefts in the Dawn Winery cellars. The Adventurers’ Guild has decided 
		   to secure the cellar door passwords using a special cipher device. But the cipher device itself requires various specifications….which the guild 
		   decided to find out by touring the entire Teyvat.
		   PS: The Guild started from the sands of Deshret then travelled through the forests of Sumeru and finally to the cherry blossoms of Inazuma

Given: A web instance

Solution:
After starting up the website you see some symbol ciphers. After using the inspect tab, you can see the source code (script.js) of the website and the deciphered
text for the images is already given in the source code (image_1.png). After entering in those values, you get a new ciphertext (image_2.png). After trying and 
trying for a while I noticed something strange. The deciphered texts made up some pattern which is required for the engima machine decryptor. So i made a note of 
the ciphertext and all the deciphered text i got from the source code and entered those values in the engima machine decryptor (image_3.png) and after cleaning up
the output a bit i get the flag!
