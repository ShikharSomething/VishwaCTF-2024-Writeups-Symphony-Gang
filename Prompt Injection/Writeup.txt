Chall Name: Prompt Injection
Chall Description: I have this collection of poems and whenever I am happy I have a look at them, hope you like it.

Given: A web instance.

Solution:
After loading up the website, you can access one of the three poems, and apparently the id parameter is vulnerable to lfi. After a bit of guessing around you find the
path "/app" through lfi and then you can view the source code of the website (shown in image_1) by using the path "/app/app.py" and you can view the secret (shown in
image_2) through the path "/app/config/secret.py" and then you can run the exploit.py script to get the flag. The script basically forges cookies according to the
source code of the website and then just prints out the flag.

Note: By running the script you would get the flag in flag{} format (maybe because it is stored on the server in that format) but just convert it to VishwaCTF{} format

Flag:
VishwaCTF{W3lcome_t0_p03m_p0ck3t}
