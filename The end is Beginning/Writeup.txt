Chall Name: The End is Beginning
Chall Description: Me and my friends just finished our final semester of B.Tech, so we decided to have a trip somewhere, but due to some reason, many of them were 
		   not available for the trip, but we were all ok as less is more. As the trip was about to end, one of my friends said we should try scuba diving 
		   here. I was scared of that, but my friends said, If you don't risk anything, you risk everything. Seriously, why do we have to risk our lives for
		   half an hour? It's impossible for me, I said. But they motivated me all night, and then it was time for the dive. I screamed, Impossible is not a 
		   word in my vocabulary, and dived in. After all this, when I came back to my room, I realised I was low on money, so I called and asked my father 
		   for some help by singing something like this:
		   Iâ€™d be gone to my dad
		   And ask for some cash
		   I ran ......
		   All the Hustle towards the trip was worth it, as we enjoyed it a lot and made some awesome memories throughout the trip.

Solution:
There are some song lyrics in the Description. I google those lyrics (image_1.png) and get the song to be "BT ho gayi". The singer of the song is Paradox aka
Tanishq Singh. And after reading through the lyrics of the song i find out the amount to be 5000 (rs) (image_2.png). And that gives the flag.
